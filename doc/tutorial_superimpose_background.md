# %Superimpose an object with the background {#tutorial_superimpose_background}

This tutorial is based upon the [previous one](@ref tutorial_superimpose) and
explain how to add a background image to the rendering process.
Our good ol' fiend ðŸ‘¾ from Space Invaders will finally have _Space_ behind
him.

One of the main reason to why this is important, and to why actually this
library exists, is that in computer vision and augmented-reality applications
you want your mesh to be in a specific pose relative to a camera viewpoint.
As a consequence, you usually have an image grabbed from a camera and the pose
of an object relative to it.

Here is another commented, ready-to-go, code snippet (using default shaders)!<br>

You should get something like this:
